# 🧠 Mental Health Detection Models: Anxiety & Depression

This repository contains two machine learning models trained to identify indicators of **anxiety** and **depression**. The models are implemented in Jupyter notebooks and can be used for research, educational purposes, or as a baseline for more advanced mental health analytics projects.

## 🧠 Models Overview

### 1. `trained_anxiety.ipynb`

This notebook includes:

- Data preprocessing for anxiety-related features  
- Feature extraction and vectorization  
- Model training using *[insert algorithm, e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or BERT]*  
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Confusion matrix and visualizations  

### 2. `trained_depression.ipynb`

This notebook includes:

- Data loading and cleaning for depression detection  
- Natural language processing (if applicable)  
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning  
- Performance evaluation and metrics visualization  
- Inference on new or sample data

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run the notebooks, install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

Additional packages (if used):

```bash
pip install nltk xgboost keras tensorflow spacy transformers
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebooks and run cells sequentially (ensure dataset paths are correctly configured if applicable).

---

## 📊 Expected Output

Each notebook provides:

- Model performance metrics on validation/test sets  
- Confusion matrices  
- ROC curves or feature importance graphs (if applicable)  

---

## 📌 Important Notes

- These models are for **educational/research purposes only**.  
- **Not intended for clinical diagnosis or treatment decisions.**  
- Always anonymize sensitive data before processing.
