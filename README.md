# üß† Mental Health Meme Classifier - Inference Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for performing inference on mental health memes using pretrained models. The classification is divided into two tasks:

- `trained_anxiety.ipynb`: Classifies memes into one of several anxiety categories (single-label classification).
- `trained_depression.ipynb`: Predicts multiple subcategories of depression (multi-label classification).

Both notebooks use pretrained multimodal models that combine visual and textual meme features.

## üß† Models Overview

### 1. `trained_anxiety.ipynb`

This notebook includes:

- Data preprocessing for anxiety-related features  
- Feature extraction and vectorization  
- Model training using *[insert algorithm, e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or BERT]*  
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Confusion matrix and visualizations  

### 2. `trained_depression.ipynb`

This notebook includes:

- Data loading and cleaning for depression detection  
- Natural language processing (if applicable)  
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning  
- Performance evaluation and metrics visualization  
- Inference on new or sample data

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

To run the notebooks, install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

Additional packages (if used):

```bash
pip install nltk xgboost keras tensorflow spacy transformers
```

## üìä Expected Output

Each notebook provides:

- Model performance metrics on validation/test sets  
- Confusion matrices  
- ROC curves or feature importance graphs (if applicable)
